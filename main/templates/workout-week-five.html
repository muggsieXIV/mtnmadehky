						This Week will start with a challenge. When we get back on the ice Tim and I want to know your scores.

                    <br>
                    <h6>Part One: Speed</h6>
                    <p>For each of these tests, complete it 5 times and take your best score. </p>

                            to the top, back to x, to right, back to x, back to start. Feet together, shoulders square to the top at all times. If you do not land on x, or do not go over
                            the box lines you fail your attempt and will need to restart. 
                        </li>

                            Max Push Ups: Go at a consistent “One-One Thousand” pace. You must fully go down to 90, and all the way back to full extension. 
                            Keep your body flat/level. If your form fails or you fall off pace you fail out.

                            Max Sit Ups: Keep your feet flat, hands behind your head, bring your chest all the way to your knees. You must not pause. If you pause, or fail to bring your

                            Max Dips: Find a sturdy platform that is high enough off the ground that when your arms are planted and at 90 your butt is off the ground. Legs should be 
                            straight out, and toes up. Go at a “One One-Thousand” pace. If you do not extend fully to the top, or all the way to 90, move your feet, or you pause you fail. 
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            bent to 90. If your back comes off the wall, you rest your arms on your legs, move your feet, or go above/below 90 you fail.

					<h3>Cool Down</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						Cool Downs prevent injury, and allow your body to recover faster. It also is a great
						opportunity to really work on your flexibility. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						Each stretch you should hold for no less than 30 seconds.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						Make sure you stretch out your Calves, Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Groin, Hip-Flexiors, Back,
						Shoulders, and Neck. Really work of your flexibility, and take long slow breathes. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						It's a really good idea to drink 2 bottles of water, a gatorade, and a protein shake after any workout. 
						Your body needs hydration, electrolytes, protein, sugars, vitamins, and carbohydrates to properly recover post 
						workout. Nutritional timing is 30-60 minutes after any workout. 
						Make sure you're taking care of your diet, and putting in what it needs to increase your optimum fitness.

                            For these exercises draw out a line about an inch wide, or use an old hockey stick. complete each one in 3 sets, with 90 seconds per set. Do NOT pace yourself. 
                            Get from 1st to 6th gear by the end of the block and keep the pedal down. Be out of your comfort zone, but stay in control. You don't want to lose composure. 
                            Great athletes look unphased and calm while under pressure and giving it their all.
