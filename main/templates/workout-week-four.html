                    <br>
                    <h6>Part One</h6>
					<ol class="text-left">
						<li>High Knees and Back x2 (Chest up, knees all the way to your chest. Go as fast as you possibly can, then go faster.)</li>
						<li>Lunges and back x3 (Form is the most important thing here. Barely touch your knee to the ground directly below your body. Shoulder blades pulled back, Chest up.)</li>
                        <li>Squat Hops and back x3 (Jump High and Long. You should get the distance of your body height at an absolute minimum. Knees to chest on your jump, when loading get your butt down to or below 90.)</li>
                        <li>Side Lunge and back x3 (Face the same direction the whole time so that you alternate sides. Keep you chest up, knees to 90, and stay level. You should not be bobbing up and down.)</li>

                        <li>50 Push ups - Get to or below 90 or it does not count. Also reach fully to the top or the rep does not count.</li>
                        <li>
                            50 Sit ups - Do NOT have someone hold your feet. You must be able to keep your feet flat while doing a sit up.
                            If not, your abs are too weak. Also, keep your arms crossed, your shoulder blades must touch the ground, and your 
                            elbows while flat to your torso shsould touch your knees.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            50 Squat hops - Down below 90, keep your chest up, explode as high as you can. Do not sacrafice form for fatigue or burn. Fight 
                            through and hold your form the entire time. Bad form reps DO NOT COUNT. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            50 Single leg squats (each leg). Do not use a box or wall to balance. Free stand, balance, and keep your non-using foot off the ground.
                            Keep your chest up, butt down, and shoulder blades pulled back. Squat to 90. For these ones, I do not want Piston Squats, keep your leg behind you
                            like a skating position. 
                        </li>

					<h3>Cool Down</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						Cool Downs prevent injury, and allow your body to recover faster. It also is a great
						opportunity to really work on your flexibility. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						Each stretch you should hold for no less than 30 seconds.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						Make sure you stretch out your Calves, Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Groin, Hip-Flexiors, Back,
						Shoulders, and Neck. Really work of your flexibility, and take long slow breathes. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text-left">
						It's a really good idea to drink 2 bottles of water, a gatorade, and a protein shake after any workout. 
						Your body needs hydration, electrolytes, protein, sugars, vitamins, and carbohydrates to properly recover post 
						workout. Nutritional timing is 30-60 minutes after any workout. 
						Make sure you're taking care of your diet, and putting in what it needs to increase your optimum fitness.
